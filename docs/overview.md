# Project Overview

Alita Agent is a self-evolving AI framework that focuses on dynamic tool creation and autonomous task execution. It pairs a ManagerAgent with a WebAgent to plan, research, and build new capabilities on the fly.

Key features include:

- **Self-Evolving Architecture**: Generates and refines tools as needed for a given task.
- **Modular Design**: Components for memory, planning, and secure sandbox execution keep responsibilities separated.
- **LLM Agnostic**: Supports multiple providers via a simple configuration layer.

See the rest of the documentation in this folder for setup instructions and deeper technical details.
